# Boids Demo for NumDot

A real-time Boids simulation powered by [NumDot](https://github.com/Ivorforce/NumDot) â€” a tensor math and scientific computation library for the [Godot](https://godotengine.org) game engine.

## About NumDot

NumDot is inspired by the Python library [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and leverages [xtensor](https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xtensor) under the hood.  
For a comparison between NumPy, xtensor, and NumDot, see [this overview](https://numdot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to-use/numpy-xtensor-numdot.html).

## Boids Demo

The Boids Demo is included as part of the NumDot repository. It demonstrates emergent flocking behavior using both classic Godot logic and efficient, vectorized NumDot operations.  
You can interact with the simulation parameters, observe real-time performance differences, and use this demo as a starting point for your own experiments with NumDot.
